There are a few main ways that people fast, have a read and then an experiment to find out what is going to be best for you.

### Lean Gains

This is mainly for people that are exercising regularly and need to have more regular feeding windows. Generally lean gainers will fast for either 16 hours or 20 hours each day, with the rest of day allowing for feeding.

Most people will fast from after dinner (last meal of the day) until lunch or dinner. This is because starting with sleep gives you a great headstart into the fasting period and means you only have to hold out for a few more hours. Breakfast can also be replaced with a coffee or tea which can help to curb your hunger.

### Alternate Day Fasting

With ADF you basically extend your fasting and eating periods, you have one day off and one day on. Fast for 24 hours and then spend the next day as normal.

Things to note with this one is that it is really hard to make up for a whole day of missed food and for some people it is really difficult to eat in such an irregular pattern.

### Occasional Fasting

Another way to gain the benefits of intermittent fasting is to have a go doing it for 24 hours one or two days a week. Heck you can even gain some of the benefits doing it one day a month.

This a great option if you are just wanting to get started and get a feel for it. It also can't hurt to skip a few meals a week.
