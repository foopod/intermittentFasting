### Not eating is bad for you though

That's not a question. Eating 3 meals a day is a cultural thing that humans have only recently developed. Our hunter gatherer ancestors would go for days without eating and they had to be in peak physical condition just to survive. Fasting for a window of more than 12 or so hours speeds up metabolism and hardens our insulin receptors. 

The reason most people feel they need to eat every few hours because of the constant steam of glucose your body is getting, without it you feel hungry pretty quick. This is why people that try Keto (diet that limits carb intake) they find that they are simply not as hungry as they used to be.

In fact [here](http://pmj.bmj.com/content/49/569/203.short) is a case of a man that fasted for over a year, living on nothing but supplements and his body fat. The medical journal states that "Prolonged fasting in this patient had no ill-effects".

### Will I lose muscle though IF?

Nope. There is this great myth of your body trying to hold onto the fat and wasting away muscle when you starve yourself. Which is ridiculous because firstly our muscles can only store a very small amount of energy that the body can use and secondly because our fat stores are actually really easy to tap into when we need it. 


### Can I still hit the gym?

Absolutely, but keep in mind that intermittent fasting is kind of like a workout on its own. It is recommended to time your workouts for right before you break your fast to replenish your body.

Listen to your body, if you are feeling tired you might be over doing it. If you are concerned then bring it back to Calories In Calories Out (CACO), I know it isn't any fun, but tracking calories is the best way to figure out if you are on track.

### Can I still eat/drink x?

Maybe. The idea of fasting is to not eat anything and just drink water. But there are other things you can have...

You can have..
* Black Coffee
* Tea
* Zero Calorie drinks
* Supplements (Note: Some are much more effective when taken with food)

You can't have..
* Calories

Some people report that eating or drink a small amount of calories has little or no effect on their fast. Some common examples are a little dark chocolate or a splash of cream in your coffee. While there is some evidence that pure fat calories the cream won't affect your fast because it won't add to the glucose that you are trying to burn off, but it will still trigger an insulin response and slow your fat burning a little.
