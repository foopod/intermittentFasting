### Fasting is not for everyone

For **women** looking to try IF it is important that it is done with care. There is research done that indicates that women don't need to fast as long as men to see the same results, so be careful not to over do it. Lots of research has been done around women and intermittent fasting, several articles suggest that women only need to fast for 12-14 hours to get all the benefits of IF. For most women IF is safe to try if they are not breastfeeding, pregnant or trying to get pregnant.

Fast with caution if you have **diseases such as Tuberculosis, Hepatitis or HIV**. Fasting causes an autophagic response (triggering the body's natural way of breaking down cells), this is not a bad thing normally, however the diseases mentioned use Autophagy to replicate. Please consult a medical professional before trying intermittent fasting.

IF is safe for **seniors** and there are several positive effects for brain health, in addition to this some research has been done that suggests that IF can decrease the risk of cancer, Alzheimer's, Huntington's and strokes.

People **under the age of 18** don't need to fast, at these ages the growth hormones are still in high levels and their metabolism is a mean machine. If they are overweight it is probably from too much sugar that even their youthful body can't cope with.

If you have an **eating disorder** you should also seek medical advice before trying intermittent fasting.

### Other concerns

Intermittent fasting for most people is a significant change in diet. It helps to be aware of some of the common things people experience.

People sometimes develop **caffeine addictions**. Coffee is a quick and simple "meal replacement" as caffeine is a known hunger suppressant. If you are swapping out your breakfast for coffee make sure that you don't get carried away in the mornings, 1-2 cups of coffee or tea is plenty to see you through.

Another mistake people make when picking up IF is **overeating when they break fast**. When you first start fasting you will find yourself incredibly hungry, its only natural because your body is acclimatizing. Don't take this to mean you need to fit in three meals to make up for the two that you skipped. Be sensible about how much you need, if you aren't sure how much you should be eating then do some rough maths so that calories in is less than calories out.

If even after a few weeks you are still **counting down the minutes** till when your 16 hour fast ends then maybe  you are not getting enough low GI foods in your feeding window. Try to cut down on the sugars and other carbohydrates, or swap them out for whole grains alternatives.

If you still don't think intermittent fasting is for you, then take a look at [Keto](http://reddit.com/r/keto). You get similar benefits and you get to eat whenever you want, but you have to cut glucose out of your diet almost entirely.
