  Hey there! This entire website is open source. If you see anything that looks amiss or would like something to be added then send me a <a href="https://github.com/foopod/intermittentFasting">pull request</a> or flick me an <a href="mailto:jonathonshields@gmail.com">email</a>.
</p>

I made this site because I was sick of people telling me that what I was doing was **wrong**. 

I knew there was plenty of evidence to back up IF, but not all in one place. So this is the culmination of everything can find on the topic (and most importantly with references).

If you have any questions feel free to get in touch.
