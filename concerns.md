Intermittent fasting for most people is a significant change in diet. This is a good place to start so you have a headsup and can avoid these.

People sometimes develop **caffeine addictions**. Coffee is a quick and simple "meal replacement" as caffeine is a known hunger suppressant. If you are swapping out your breafast for coffee make sure that you don't get carried away in the mornings, 1-2 cups of coffee or tea is plenty to see you through.

Another mistake people make when picking up IF is **overeating when they break fast**. When you first start fasting you will find yourself incredibly hungry, its only natural because your body is acclimatizing. Don't take this to mean you need to fit in three meals to make up for the two that you skipped. Be sensible about how much you need, if you aren't sure how much you should be eating then do some rough maths so that calories in is less than calories out.

If even after a few weeks you are still **counting down the minutes** till when your 16 hour fast ends then maybe  you are not getting enough low GI foods in your feeding window. Try to cut down on the sugars and other carbohydrates, or swap them out for whole grains alternatives.

If you still don't think intermittent fasting is for you, then take a look at [Keto](http://reddit.com/r/keto). You get similar benefits and you get to eat whenever you want, but you have to cut glucose out of your diet almost entirely.
