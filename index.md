There are a few different routines that people fall into when fasting, but they almost always fall into one of these two categories...

* Fasting everyday - In periods of 16-20 hour fasts followed by a period of eating.
* Fasting for >24 hours - Fasting for a day or more at a time.

**[Some people struggle](/concerns)**. IF isn't for everyone and it may be more difficult for some rather than others. Some people will over eat after a fast because of how hungry they feel, others can develop caffeine addictions as coffee for most is a go to when you are feeling hungry. As with any major diet change it needs to be well managed and care needs to be taken to make sure you are still getting the nutrients your body needs.
