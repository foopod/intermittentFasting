### Well researched benefits

Intermittent Fasting is proven to **lower insulin**, this allows the hormone([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone-sensitive_lipase)) that lets you **burn fat** to do its job ([2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15640462), [3](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193152441400200X)). This also means that intermittent fasting has been recommended as a way to help **treat diabetes** ([4](https://www.diabetesselfmanagement.com/blog/intermittent-fasting-not-so-fast/)).

Studies say that IF **aids in cell repair** ([5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3106288/), [6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106691)). This means an **increase in longevity** and **protection from disease** ([7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2622429/)).

IF is proven to **increase metabolism** by  activating a growth hormone which stimulates cell reproduction, growth and repair ([8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2405717),[9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone), [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10837292), [11](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC329619/), [12](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1548337), [13](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12425705), [14](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2355952))

**Weightloss** is an obvious benefit and the main reason that people are attracted to intermittent fasting  ([15](http://www.translationalres.com/article/S1931-5244(14)00200-X/abstract), [16](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21410865))

IF is know to **fight Oxidative stress** ([17](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095528630400261X)) and inflamation ([18](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17291990/), [19](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17374948), [20](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23244540))

### Suggested benefits

Studies have been done that indicate **lowers risk of cancer** in intermittent fasters ([21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24048020)).

Other studies suggest **decreased risks of Alzeimers and strokes** ([22](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2844782/)).

And it is generally accepted that IF is one method for **increasing lifespan** ([23](http://geronj.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/1/36.short), [24](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047637400001093), [25](http://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/212538))

It also increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (a brain hormone) ([26](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11220789), [27](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16011467),[28](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC151440/)), to which a deficiency is often **correlated to depression and various other brain problems** ([29](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3022308/)).
